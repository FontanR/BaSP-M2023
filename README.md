# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 02
### What did we learn?
In week 2 we learned how to use the git tool to generate a remote repository in GitHub. The problem we decided to tackle to put into practice this new knowledge was to create the landing page of a gym in HTML format so we also had to learn this language (its syntax, its semantics, use a text editor, etc.).
### What did we develop?
The index.html file will show you MegaRocket's landing page (the gym page). Here you can see a menu with a variaty of options like sign up, log in or get some information. In the sections below you can also send a message to the company, check out their memberships or socials, learn a bit about the company or get into socials.

## Week 03
### What did we learn?
In this week we learned about css styles. If you want people to spend time on your page it must look pretty. So we learned how to use a specific format like font type, size, color, borders, the location of the text and images inside the page, etc.
### What did we develop?
We continue with the index.html file but now we link a css stylesheet that will make the landing page of Megarocket looks similar to the one we did in figma 2 weeks ago. To achieve that we do not only code the css file but also had to modify the html file.
