# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 02
### What did we learn?
In week 2 we learned how to use the git tool to generate a remote repository in GitHub. The problem we decided to tackle to put into practice this new knowledge was to create the landing page of a gym in HTML format so we also had to learn this language (its syntax, its semantics, use a text editor, etc.).
### What did we develop?
The index.html file will show you MegaRocket's landing page (the gym page). Here you can see a menu with a variaty of options like sign up, log in or get some information. In the sections below you can also send a message to the company, check out their memberships or socials, learn a bit about the company or get into socials.
