# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 02
### What did we learn?
In week 2 we learned how to use the git tool to generate a remote repository in GitHub. The problem we decided to tackle to put into practice this new knowledge was to create the landing page of a gym in HTML format so we also had to learn this language (its syntax, its semantics, use a text editor, etc.).
### What did we develop?
The index.html file will show you MegaRocket's landing page (the gym page). Here you can see a menu with a variaty of options like sign up, log in or get some information. In the sections below you can also send a message to the company, check out their memberships or socials, learn a bit about the company or get into socials.

## Week 03
### What did we learn?
In this week we learned about css styles. If you want people to spend time on your page it must look pretty. So we learned how to use a specific format like font type, size, color, borders, the location of the text and images inside the page, etc.
### What did we develop?
We continue with the index.html file but now we link a css stylesheet that will make the landing page of Megarocket looks similar to the one we did in figma 2 weeks ago. To achieve that we do not only code the css file but also had to modify the html file.

## Week 04
### What did we learn?
This week we learned how to generate a responsive website with css using flexbox and media queries. Flexbox is used to place the components of the page and the media queries are used to change the propoerties of the components when the resolution settings are changed.
### What did we develop?
Now not only we want our page to be similar to the one designed in figma but we also want it to adapt depending on the device (phones, tablets or pc screen) we are using to see the page.

## Week 05
### What did we learn?
This week we learned the basics of JavaScript programming. The concepts covered were variables and operators, strings, arrays, if else, for loops and functions.
### What did we develop?
We had to develop a series of exercises using the concepts learned during the week. These exercises were arranged in 6 different blocks so we developed 6 js files indexed to an empty html.

## Week 06
### What did we learn?
This time we learned how to use and manipulate the DOM with javascript. This is very interesting since it integrates all the contents seen in the previous weeks. Using javascript we are now able to modify the html in conjunction with the css making our page interactive with the user.
### What did we develop?
We continue with the design of the megarocket website. Now we added the login and sign up pages (we made the html and css of both) and we also added the validations for the inputs of the different fields using javascript. With this we added visual effects to indicate if the information requested in the fields complied with the validations or not.
